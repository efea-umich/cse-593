abstract = {We present WrisText - a one-handed text entry technique for smartwatches using the joystick-like motion of the wrist. A user enters text by whirling the wrist of the watch hand, towards six directions which each represent a key in a circular keyboard, and where the letters are distributed in an alphabetical order. The design of WrisText was an iterative process, where we first conducted a study to investigate optimal key size, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90\% striking accuracy. We then computed an optimal keyboard layout, considering a joint optimization problem of striking accuracy, striking comfort, word disambiguation. We evaluated the performance of WrisText through a five-day study with 10 participants in two text entry scenarios: hand-up and hand-down. On average, participants achieved a text entry speed of 9.9 WPM across all sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 WPM by the end of the last day.},

abstract = {The integration of various technologies with our daily lives, such as smartwatches, smartphones, smart TVs, etc. has proven beneficial. However, the HCI community is still in search for more intuitive text entry methods for smart devices. In this study, we explore a new text entry method—AcousticType for smart devices where a smartwatch is leveraged to infer what a user is typing on a physical keyboard employing the acoustic signals as a secondary input mechanism. AcousticType employs four modules: Noise Cancelling, Keystroke Detection, Key Identification and Word Correction. Our results show AcousticType recovers up to 98\% of the typed text. We also showed that utilizing the noise cancellation, AcousticType is robust to the changes in the environment, which further boosts the practicality. The findings are promising and call for further investigation into new types of text entry methods that utilize acoustic signals to cope with the usability issues in smart devices.},
