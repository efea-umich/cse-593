In some cases, the backspace undoes the auto-correct.],

[Use more distinguishable buttons, or consider incorporating text or real-world icons for clarity.\ 
Ensure consistent design elements and consider using clearer icons or text to avoid confusion.],

  [Match between system and the real world], 
  [Major],
